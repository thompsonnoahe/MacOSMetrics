# MacOS Metrics

This Node.js addon package is intended for use with the Stream Deck plugin, GPU Metrics, for MacOS.

A huge shoutout to the contributors of `macmon` for their work in retrieving the data needed for that utility. This package uses their code, so, thank you to them! Check out their app [here](https://github.com/vladkens/macmon).
